# Deferred Rectangle Enhancement Tasks

## ðŸš§ Tasks Skipped for Minimal Moveable Rectangles

These tasks are **not critical** for basic movement functionality but should be revisited for a production-ready experience:

### **UI/UX Enhancements**
- [ ] **User Attribution Visuals**
  - User avatars on rectangles
  - "Created by Alice" tooltips
  - Color coding by creator
  - **Why deferred:** Movement works without knowing who created what

- [ ] **Advanced Visual States**
  - Hover effects and highlights  
  - Smooth selection animations
  - Drag preview styling
  - **Why deferred:** Basic selection outline sufficient for movement

- [ ] **Enhanced Selection UX**
  - Click-and-drag selection area
  - Multi-select with Ctrl+click
  - Selection keyboard shortcuts
  - **Why deferred:** Single-select sufficient for basic movement

### **Performance & Scalability**
- [ ] **Rendering Optimizations**
  - React.memo for Rectangle components
  - Viewport culling for large canvases
  - Object pooling for many rectangles
  - **Why deferred:** Performance acceptable with <50 rectangles

- [ ] **Batch Operation Support**
  - Multi-object movement
  - Bulk Firestore updates
  - Optimistic update strategies
  - **Why deferred:** Single rectangle movement is foundation

### **Collaboration Features**
- [ ] **Real-time Editing Indicators**
  - Show who's currently dragging objects
  - Live cursor positions during drag
  - Collaborative selection conflicts
  - **Why deferred:** Basic sync works without live editing state

- [ ] **Advanced Conflict Resolution**
  - Operational transforms for simultaneous edits
  - "Last write wins" visual feedback
  - Edit history and undo/redo
  - **Why deferred:** Simple overwrite acceptable for now

### **Error Handling & Robustness**
- [ ] **Enhanced Offline Support**
  - Local-only movement when offline
  - Sync queue for reconnection
  - Conflict resolution on reconnect
  - **Why deferred:** Basic error handling covers most cases

- [ ] **User Feedback Improvements**
  - Movement success/failure notifications
  - Sync status indicators per object
  - Network lag compensation
  - **Why deferred:** Console logging sufficient for development

### **Testing & Maintenance**
- [ ] **Comprehensive Unit Tests**
  - Rectangle component behavior testing
  - Movement logic validation
  - Firestore integration mocking
  - **Why deferred:** Manual testing covers current scope

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - Multi-user movement scenarios
  - Network interruption handling
  - Browser compatibility testing
  - **Why deferred:** Basic functionality working proves concept

### **Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Rectangle Deletion System**
  - Delete key support
  - Right-click context menu
  - Bulk deletion
  - **Why deferred:** Not needed for movement proof-of-concept

- [ ] **Resize & Rotation**
  - Corner drag handles for resizing
  - Rotation handles and logic
  - Aspect ratio constraints
  - **Why deferred:** Movement is separate concern from transformation

- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**
  - Arrow key movement
  - Precise positioning with Shift+arrows
  - Tab navigation between objects
  - **Why deferred:** Mouse movement sufficient initially

## ðŸ“‹ **Revisit Priority Order**
When returning to these tasks, implement in this order:

1. **User Attribution Visuals** (multiplayer clarity)
2. **Enhanced Selection UX** (professional feel)
3. **Real-time Editing Indicators** (collaboration awareness) 
4. **Performance Optimizations** (scaling preparation)
5. **Comprehensive Testing** (reliability assurance)
6. **Advanced Features** (feature completeness)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria for Deferred Items**
Each task should be considered complete when:
- Feature works smoothly with 2+ concurrent users
- No performance degradation with 50+ rectangles  
- Graceful error handling for network issues
- Professional visual polish matching design tools
- Comprehensive test coverage >80%
