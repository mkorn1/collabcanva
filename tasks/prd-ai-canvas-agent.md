# AI Canvas Agent - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Target Points:** 25/25  
**Timeline:** 5-8 hours  
**Last Updated:** Current session

---

## Introduction/Overview

Build a natural language interface for canvas manipulation using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini. Users type commands like "Create a red circle" or "Arrange these shapes in a row" and the AI translates them into canvas operations. All operations sync in real-time across users via existing Firestore infrastructure.

The AI agent will provide an intuitive way for users to manipulate canvas objects through conversational commands, making the collaborative canvas more accessible and efficient for complex design tasks.

---

## Goals

1. **Natural Language Interface**: Enable users to manipulate canvas objects using conversational commands
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: All AI operations sync across all users in real-time
3. **Comprehensive Command Support**: Support 8+ distinct command types across creation, manipulation, layout, and complex operations
4. **Performance Excellence**: Sub-2 second response times with 90%+ accuracy
5. **User Experience**: Provide preview functionality with approve/reject options for command safety

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Command Breadth & Capability (10 points)

**Requirement:** Support 8+ distinct command types across 4 categories.

#### A. Creation Commands (Minimum 2 required)
1. The system must allow users to create individual shapes (rectangles, circles, text) with specified position, size, and styling
2. The system must support creating multiple shapes in a single command
3. The system must provide smart defaults for unspecified properties (position, size, colors)

**Examples:**
- "Create a red circle at position 100, 200"
- "Add a text layer that says 'Hello World'"
- "Make three blue rectangles"

#### B. Manipulation Commands (Minimum 2 required)
4. The system must allow moving objects to absolute positions or relative movements
5. The system must support resizing objects with absolute dimensions or relative scaling
6. The system must enable rotating objects by specified degrees
7. The system must allow changing object styling (colors, stroke, opacity)

**Examples:**
- "Move the blue rectangle to the center"
- "Resize the circle to be twice as big"
- "Rotate the text 45 degrees"
- "Change the red square to green"

#### C. Layout Commands (Minimum 1 required)
8. The system must arrange multiple objects in patterns (rows, columns, grids)
9. The system must distribute spacing evenly between objects

**Examples:**
- "Arrange these shapes in a horizontal row"
- "Create a 3x3 grid of squares"
- "Space these elements evenly"

#### D. Complex Commands (Minimum 1 required)
10. The system must create multi-element layouts with semantic meaning and proper positioning

**Examples:**
- "Create a login form with username and password fields"
- "Build a navigation bar with 4 menu items"
- "Make a card layout with title and description"

### 2. Complex Command Execution (8 points)

**Requirements:**
11. Complex commands must produce 3+ elements with proper positioning and styling
12. The system must apply smart defaults for colors, sizes, and spacing when not specified
13. The system must handle ambiguous requests by providing reasonable styling choices
14. The system must maintain visual consistency across complex layouts

**Example: "Create a login form"**
Must produce:
- Title text ("Login")
- Username field (rectangle + placeholder text)
- Password field (rectangle + placeholder text)
- Submit button (rectangle + button text)

**Total:** 7 objects, properly aligned vertically with consistent spacing

### 3. AI Performance & Reliability (7 points)

**Requirements:**

**Speed:**
15. The system must respond within 2 seconds (measured from user hits Enter → objects appear)
16. The system must log timestamps before API call and after object creation for performance monitoring

**Accuracy:**
17. The system must achieve 90%+ success rate across 10 test commands
18. Success is defined as: command executes and produces expected result within margin of error
19. Test suite must include: 3 creation, 3 manipulation, 2 layout, 2 complex commands

**User Experience:**
20. The system must provide a natural chat interface similar to ChatGPT/Claude
21. The system must show loading indicator during API processing
22. The system must display confirmation messages after execution
23. The system must show error messages with clarification prompts

**Multiplayer Support:**
24. All users must see AI-created objects in real-time via Firestore sync
25. Multiple users must be able to send AI commands simultaneously without conflicts
26. AI operations must follow existing conflict resolution strategy (last-write-wins)

---

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Voice commands (text-only interface)
- Image/screenshot interpretation
- Learning from user corrections (no fine-tuning)
- Undo specifically for AI commands (use preview mode instead)
- AI-suggested commands (proactive assistance)
- Collaborative AI (multiple users co-piloting)
- Manipulation of code or system settings
- Canvas background modifications
- User permission changes

---

## Design Considerations

### UI Components
- **AIAgentPanel**: Floating panel in bottom-right corner (400px × 600px)
- **Preview Mode**: Temporary overlay showing proposed changes with approve/reject buttons
- **Chat Interface**: Message list with user/AI/system message types
- **Loading States**: Clear indicators during API processing

### User Experience
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Cmd+K to open/close AI panel
- **Preview Safety**: All commands show preview before execution
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with suggested actions
- **Rate Limiting**: 4 commands per minute per user

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-4o-mini with function calling
- **Canvas State**: Work in absolute coordinates (not viewport-relative)
- **Selected Objects**: If user has objects selected and doesn't specify which object, assume selected objects
- **Firestore Sync**: Use existing infrastructure for real-time collaboration

### Performance Limits
- **Max Objects**: 25 objects per command
- **Max Sub-elements**: 100 sub-elements for complex commands (configurable variable)
- **Rate Limiting**: 4 commands per minute per user
- **Response Time**: Sub-2 seconds target

### Error Handling
- **Object Resolution**: When object not found, ask for clarification or suggest similar objects
- **Partial Failures**: Execute successful parts, report failures
- **Conflict Resolution**: Use existing Firestore conflict resolution strategy

---

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds average (measured end-to-end)
